# Looking for Maintainers

I have personally chosen to bite the bullet and switch to Jetbrain's new UI which has similar, not as great, but sufficient colored project functionality built in. As such, this extension is unmaintained and as newer JB IDEs come out, become incompatible. It'll generally need continually bumping and adjustments to handle changes in JetBrain's UI. If you're interested, please make an issue, I'll move this project to an organization, and I'll try to support however I can and am willing to. I will do my best to not give the *silent* treatment.

<!-- Plugin description -->
Remember your projects by color! Colorize the window somehow to differentiate your open projects. Updated and [maintained](https://github.com/nowtilous/Project-Color/issues/) fork of Project-Color from [yon/@nowtilous](https://github.com/nowtilous/).

NOTE: [This does not work with the new GUI. The functionality should be built in though when it is out of beta though](https://blog.jetbrains.com/idea/2023/06/intellij-idea-2023-2-eap-6/#:~:text=User%20experience-,Colored%20project%20headers%20in%20the%20new%20UI,-IntelliJ%20IDEA%202023.2)

Working on multiple projects simultaneously with Jetbrains products based on IntelliJ can be difficult, since they all look the same at a glance. This plugin solves that by giving the user the option to colorize each project's window in a noticeable way.
