<!-- Plugin description -->
Remember your projects by color! Colorize the window somehow to differentiate your open projects. Updated and [maintained](https://github.com/nowtilous/Project-Color/issues/) fork of Project-Color.

NOTE: This does not work with the new GUI, yet.

Working on multiple projects simultaneously with Jetbrains products based on IntelliJ can be difficult, since they all look the same at a glance. This plugin solves that by giving the user the option to colorize each project's window in a noticeable way.
